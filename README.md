# Geometry-Dash-Game

This is a Geometry Dash game clone that i have made using REACT NATIVE on mobile , javascript and expo for running the application .
Steps to try the source code yourself =
1) Download or git pull the repository

2) Open on code editor

3)  Write : npm install OR yarn add
   in your code editor for installing the necessary packages for the code to run

4) Run the code ( npm start etc ) . Personally i used EXPO GO on my phone for running the code .

 When run it should look something like this =
