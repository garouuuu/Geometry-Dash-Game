# Geometry-Dash-Game

This is a Geometry Dash game clone that i have made using REACT NATIVE on mobile , javascript and expo for running the application .

Steps to try the source code yourself =
1) Download or git pull the repository

2) Open on code editor

3)  Write : npm install OR yarn add

4) Run the code ( npm start etc ) .
  -write W , for it to run on a local port on web . 

 When run it should look something like this =
